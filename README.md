# vote-dapp-front
front of the vote-dapp project

## developing
docker containers and back-end must be started. (cf their READMEs)  
``yarn start`` to launch this webapp

## remarks
User has to manually select the ethereum network to interact with (most 
likely using metamask). Vote-dapp surely will mostly be used on the 
Rinkeby testnet.
